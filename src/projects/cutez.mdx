Cutez is a project built with Next.js. When I started working on it, the new app/ directory structure had just been introduced, so I took the opportunity to learn it while building something useful.

The app works as a link shortener, where each user has their own dashboard to view the links they've created, track click statistics, and manage redirections.

Currently, the project has 60 active users and over 500 recorded clicks.

In the future, I plan to build a Go (Golang) API, adding more features and making the system more scalable and robust.
