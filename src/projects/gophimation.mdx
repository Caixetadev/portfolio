Gophimation is a command-line interface (CLI) built in Go
that allows users to search for anime and episodes directly from the terminal. It's designed to be fast, ad-free, and entirely focused on convenience.

To enhance the user experience,
an intelligent caching strategy was implemented, ensuring quick searches and smooth content loading.
