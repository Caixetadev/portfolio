A CLI written in Go to analyze and simulate the performance of a Bitcoin portfolio using real purchase data.

The project was designed for people who prefer working with simple files, automation, and the command line, without relying on external platforms.

**The problem**

When you buy Bitcoin or satoshis, the amount you own stays the same, but the value in USD changes over time.

After a few purchases, understanding how much you actually paid for each one requires digging through old transactions, checking the Bitcoin price on the purchase date, and doing manual calculations. This process is repetitive, slow, and error-prone.

**The solution**

The CLI automates this calculation.

Using a simple CSV file with your purchases, the CLI analyzes each transaction, calculates profit or loss based on the current price, and generates a clear portfolio summary. You can also simulate price scenarios to understand how the portfolio would behave under different market conditions.

Everything runs locally, directly in the terminal.

## Example usage

The image below shows the main command analyzing a real portfolio:

```bash
➜ btc analyze transactions.example.csv
