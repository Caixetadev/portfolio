This project was developed with the goal of studying AWS services.
Itâ€™s a fully serverless image upload application built with Go (Golang) and several AWS services. The entire infrastructure was provisioned using Terraform, which allowed me to learn a lot about both AWS and infrastructure as code.

As shown in the diagram below, the flow begins with a request to the API Gateway,
which triggers a Lambda function responsible for uploading the image to S3. After the upload, metadata about the image is sent to an SQS queue.

Another Lambda function listens to this queue and, when it detects new messages,
sends a notification email using Amazon SES.

If any failure occurs during the process,
the message is redirected to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ), and an error notification is sent to the user via Amazon SNS.
